This repository contains materials and exercises from the DeepLearning.AI short course "Quantization Fundamentals with Hugging Face", instructed by Younes Belkada and Marc Sun.

## üìö Course Overview

Generative AI models, especially large language models, often exceed the capabilities of consumer-grade hardware and are expensive to run. This course teaches you how to make these models more efficient, faster, and accessible through quantization techniques, allowing them to run on a wide variety of devices with minimal performance degradation.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- How to compress models using the Hugging Face Transformers library and the Quanto library
- Fundamentals of linear quantization, a simple yet effective method for compressing models
- Practical experience quantizing open source multimodal and language models
- Applying "downcasting" quantization with the Transformers library to load models in half their normal size using BFloat16 data type
